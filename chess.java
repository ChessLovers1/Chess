            (What if we used odd and even numbers?)
            (Odd number = Player Turn, even number = computer Turn) 
            (We just setup a counter that goes up by 1 per turn and we use the % to find out which players turn is up!)

    Rules that get checked every turn 

        Problem 1: Is King in check?
            (We just check the kings current postiton with all the opposing pieces attacking tiles)
            (We will need to make sure pieces can be moved to protect the king as well) ??
            (If king is in check and has no possible moves then he loses)
        
        Problem 2: Stalemate
            (If king has no pieces that can move and cant move himself without being in check)
